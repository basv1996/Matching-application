# Matching-application
The idea of my matching application is to find new friends for gamers. Most gamers love to play online but their real life friends have a different console or different games that they prefer. Because of this they won't be able to play online games together. Here is where my matching application comes in. With the app you'll be able to find new friends that play on the same console as you and play the same games as you are playing. So now you can build friendships with other gamers that love the same games as yourself and play the same console so you are able to enjoy the game together.

> Match with other gamer that have the same console and play the same games as yourself
